# Final Project Deliverables 01


## An overview of the intended application and WHY you feel it’s valuable.

### Overview

An online event forum where users are able to host/rsvp to events. 
Two ‘event concepts’ that influenced our design and decision for this project are:
Potlucks and Doggie Dates. 
Whereas with the Potluck, users are able to comment the food that they plan on bringing. Respectively, the intention with Doggie Dates - users would be able to comment their breed and dog’s personality in addition to event information such as “park” and “date/time”. 
The whole idea is to bring people together for a Momentous occasion.

“the growing organization of social events, such as awareness gatherings, social service, and fundraising events, even those planned by SMEs for marketing purposes, are boosting the demand for event managing software.
Further, the outbreak of the COVID-19 across the globe affecting more than 3.9 million people across 212 countries has significantly affected the market for event management software, as many reputed and recognized sports events had been postponed. For instance, ISSF International Solidarity Championships in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on 22-28 February has been delayed.”
